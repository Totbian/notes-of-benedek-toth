        <p class="tagline">
          Started writing this on the 9th of Feb, 2026.<br>
          Just a few weeks after I became 30.
          Didn't start because of my third decade, I just wanted to have a future proof place for my notes.<br>
          No filter, no bs - just random thoughts and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, I have no kids, no dogs. I've loving friends, family and my BNK.<br>
          so I still have time to write.<br>
          FYI, I will not use AI at all - use it too much anyway...
