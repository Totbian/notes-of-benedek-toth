        <h1>Notes of Benedek Toth</h1>
        <p class="tagline">
          Started writing this on the 9th of Feb, 2026. Just a few weeks after I became 30.
          Didn't start because of my third decade, but to have a future proof place for my notes.
          No filter, just things happening to me and random thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          No kids, no dogs in my life, but loving friends, family and BNK, so I still have time to write.
          I might use AI to help me write, but no slop. After all, AI is here and that puts food on my table.
