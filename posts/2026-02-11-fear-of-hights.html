          I was walking in my friend's (Sos A) building's corridor on the 3rd floor. Tiny corridor, really high up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a fear of hights.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I'm not sure anymmore...
        </p>
        <p>
          Do I fear falling or fear that I'm so curious to experience the falling that
          I don't trust my brain not convincing my body of jumping?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe a "fear of hights" is just a fear of me convicing myself of jumping, since I know the outcome already.<br>
          However, I might still want to jump. Maybe because I believe I can get a different outcome or
          because I'm inherently a curious person who want to experince the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry, so far my brain couldn't win this argument (and I don't think it ever will).<br>
