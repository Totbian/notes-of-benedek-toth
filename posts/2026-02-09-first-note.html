          I am in Barcelona. I went for a night run and did intervals. I ran at the port, but it
          was full of ferries and lorries which made it smell bad - like exhaust pipes... I had
          to stop running early as I got a bit dizzy. So I cycled home, and the exhaust
          gas smell was still strong. Maybe I was already affected too much...today was the first
          day I really smelled the Barcelona "air".

          It got me thinking. Will future generations see this era as odd? That we blindly said yes
          to gasoline cars, boats, and more just because of the ease they make without considering
          how exhaust gas affects lifespan?<br>
          Or will they say it was normal?<br>
          They might argue that without oil there is no global supply chain, migration, and
          electricity too.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the grand scheme of things, they might get to the conclusion that the tradeoff
          in lifespan, city layout, and living space was worth it to build a global society.<br>
          Maybe more people should start running at ports. We will have green parties
          winning elections in no time.<br>
