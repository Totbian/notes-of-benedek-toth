          I am in Barcelona. I went for a night run and did intervals. I ran at the port, but it
          was full of ferries and lorries, and it smelled bad. Then I cycled home, and the exhaust
          gas was still strong. Today was the first day I really smelled the bad Barcelona air.

          It got me thinking. Will future generations see this era as odd, that we blindly said yes
          to gasoline cars, boats, and more, without considering how exhaust gas affects lifespan?
          Or will they say it was normal? They might argue that without oil there is no global
          supply chain, migration is slower, and electricity is much harder to produce. In the grand
          scheme of things, maybe the tradeoff in lifespan, city layout, and space per person was
          worth it to build a global society.
